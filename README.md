# Evaluation of LLMs, benchmarking in code (python) and math.


## Project Description: 

Notebook structure for evaluating solutions (LLMs). Currently does 5 tests in Python Code and 5 tests in Math, hopefully can grow with translation, general question/answering and basic knowledge, speed (token/sec), and much more! 

Currently, the LLMbenchmark notebook has 4 LLM eval/benchmark code: Yi (6B), Vicuna (7B), Mistral (7B), and Gemma (2B). More information and explanations on how to run each notebook and evals will be in the notebook’s first cell. 

You can copy and recreate an eval for any LLM by copying the cells of a model and simply changing the model-specific parts with your model’s name. Using the YourOwnLLMbenchmark Kaggle Notebook as a template and by following the instructions in that notebook you may be able to recreate the eval but for the LLM of your choice. 


## Table of contents:

	1) LLMbenchmark Notebook: LLM eval/benchmark code for Yi (6B), Vicuna (7B), Mistral (7B), and Gemma (2B), returns the benchmark table for each. More information and details in the first cell of the notebook itself. 
	2) YourOwnLLMbenchmark Notebook: Copy the cells and change the model-specific spots with your own LLM name that you want to test in this evaluation. More information and details in the first cell of the notebook itself. 

FINAL PRODUCT = This is what the benchmark table final return of the notebook looks like if all cells are run:

## Compatibility:

Kaggle = offers 30 hours of "GPU P100" and "GPU T4 x2" + 20 hours of "TPU VM v3-8" for FREE when an account has been created and verified. Simply create and account and verify it! 

Google Colab = free T4 GPU but limited. If Pro subscription then limited but extensive amount of "A100 GPU", "L4 GPU", and "TPU v2". Simply login to a google account!

Information and explanations on how to run each notebook will be in the top cell of each of the respective notebooks.
